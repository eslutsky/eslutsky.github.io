    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The oVirt community is made up of a diverse mix of individuals using and contributing to all aspects of the project from all over the world, and we want to make sure that the community is a safe and friendly place for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code of conduct applies equally to founders, mentors, and those seeking help and guidance. It applies to all spaces managed by the oVirt project, including IRC, mailing lists, GitHub, Gerrit, oVirt events, and any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we have contribution guidelines for specific tools, we expect all members of our community to follow these general guidelines and be accountable to the community. This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended—a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, some members of the oVirt community have put together a new &lt;a href="/community/about/community-guidelines/"&gt;Community Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt; to help guide everyone through what it means to be respectful and tolerant in a global community like the oVirt Project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're not looking for a community of zero conflict (though that would be nice). When you are working with a complex project with so many people involved, conflict is inevitable. These guidelines will hopefully help set the framework for managing such conflict. For me, it comes down to making sure that listening to the other side of the argument and respecting the person making the argument is always part of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Bill and Ted said: "Be excellent to each other."&lt;/p&gt;
