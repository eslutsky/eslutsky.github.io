<h3 id="virtual-machine-general-settings-explained">Virtual Machine General Settings Explained</h3>

<p>The following table details the options available on the <strong>General</strong> tab of the <strong>New Virtual Machine</strong> and <strong>Edit Virtual Machine</strong> windows.</p>

<p><strong>Virtual Machine: General Settings</strong></p>

<table>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <td>Field Name</td>
   <td>Description</td>
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Cluster</b></td>
   <td>The name of the host cluster to which the virtual machine is attached. Virtual machines are hosted on any physical machine in that cluster in accordance with policy rules.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Template</b></td>
   <td>
   <p>The template on which the virtual machine is based. This field is set to `Blank` by default, which allows you to create a virtual machine on which an operating system has not yet been installed. Templates are displayed as **Name | Sub-version name (Sub-version number)**. Each new version is displayed with a number in brackets that indicates the relative order of the version, with a higher number indicating a more recent version.</p>
   <p>The version name is displayed as `base version` if it is the root template of the template version chain.</p>
   <p>When the virtual machine is stateless, there is an option to select the `latest` version of the template. This option means that anytime a new version of this template is created, the virtual machine is automatically recreated on restart based on the latest template.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Operating System</b></td>
   <td>The operating system. Valid values include a range of Enterprise Linux and Windows variants.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Instance Type</b></td>
   <td>
    <p>The instance type on which the virtual machine's hardware configuration can be based. This field is set to <b>Custom</b> by default, which means the virtual machine is not connected to an instance type. The other options available from this drop down menu are <b>Large</b>, <b>Medium</b>, <b>Small</b>, <b>Tiny</b>, <b>XLarge</b>, and any custom instance types that the Administrator has created.</p>
    <p>Other settings that have a chain link icon next to them are pre-filled by the selected instance type. If one of these values is changed, the virtual machine will be detached from the instance type and the chain icon will appear broken. However, if the changed setting is restored to its original value, the virtual machine will be reattached to the instance type and the links in the chain icon will rejoin.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Optimized for</b></td>
   <td>The type of system for which the virtual machine is to be optimized. There are two options: <b>Server</b>, and <b>Desktop</b>; by default, the field is set to <b>Server</b>. Virtual machines optimized to act as servers have no sound card, use a cloned disk image, and are not stateless. In contrast, virtual machines optimized to act as desktop machines do have a sound card, use an image (thin allocation), and are stateless.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Name</b></td>
   <td>The name of the virtual machine. The name must be a unique name within the data center and must not contain any spaces, and must contain at least one character from A-Z or 0-9. The maximum length of a virtual machine name is 255 characters. The name can be re-used in different data centers in the environment.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>VM ID</b></td>
   <td>The virtual machine ID. The virtual machine's creator can set a custom ID for that virtual machine. If no ID is specified during creation a UUID will be automatically assigned. For both custom and automatically-generated IDs, changes are not possible after virtual machine creation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Description</b></td>
   <td>A meaningful description of the new virtual machine.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Comment</b></td>
   <td>A field for adding plain text human-readable comments regarding the virtual machine.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Affinity Labels</b></td>
   <td>Add or remove a selected **Affinity Label**.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Stateless</b></td>
   <td>Select this check box to run the virtual machine in stateless mode. This mode is used primarily for desktop virtual machines. Running a stateless desktop or server creates a new COW layer on the VM hard disk image where new and changed data is stored. Shutting down the stateless VM deletes the new COW layer, which returns the VM to its original state. Stateless virtual machines are useful when creating machines that need to be used for a short time, or by temporary staff.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Start in Pause Mode</b></td>
   <td>Select this check box to always start the virtual machine in pause mode. This option is suitable for virtual machines which require a long time to establish a SPICE connection; for example, virtual machines in remote locations.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Delete Protection</b></td>
   <td>Select this check box to make it impossible to delete the virtual machine. It is only possible to delete the virtual machine if this check box is not selected.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Instance Images</b></td>
   <td>
    <p>Click <b>Attach</b> to attach a floating disk to the virtual machine, or click <b>Create</b> to add a new virtual disk. Use the plus and minus buttons to add or remove additional virtual disks.</p>
    <p>Click <b>Edit</b> to reopen the <b>Attach Virtual Disks</b> or <b>New Virtual Disk</b> window. This button appears after a virtual disk has been attached or created.</p>

    <p>The virtual interface the disk presents to virtual machines. <b>VirtIO</b> is faster, but requires drivers. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and later include these drivers. Windows does not include these drivers, but they can be installed from the guest tools ISO or virtual floppy disk. <b>IDE</b> devices do not require special drivers.</p>
    <p>The interface type can be updated after stopping all virtual machines that the disk is attached to.</p>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Data Center</b></td>
  <td>The data center in which the virtual disk will be available.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Storage Domain</b></td>
  <td>The storage domain in which the virtual disk will be stored. The drop-down list shows all storage domains available in the given data center, and also shows the total space and currently available space in the storage domain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Volume Type</b></td>
  <td>The volume type of the virtual disk. The drop-down list shows all available volume types. The volume type will be managed and configured on OpenStack Cinder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Activate Disk(s)</b></td>
  <td>Activate the virtual disk immediately after creation. This option is not available when creating a floating disk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Bootable</b></td>
  <td>Allows you to enable the bootable flag on the virtual disk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Shareable</b></td>
  <td>Allows you to attach the virtual disk to more than one virtual machine at a time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Read Only</b></td>
  <td>Allows you to set the disk as read-only. The same disk can be attached as read-only to one virtual machine, and as rewritable to another. This option is not available when creating a floating disk.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Mounting a journaled file system requires read-write access. Using the <strong>Read Only</strong> option is not appropriate for virtual disks that contain such file systems (e.g. <strong>EXT3</strong>, <strong>EXT4</strong>, or <strong>XFS</strong>).</p>

<table class="lt-4-cols lt-7-rows">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Field</th>
  <th>Description/Action</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><b>Name</b></td>
  <td>The name of the template. This is the name by which the template is listed in the <b>Templates</b> tab in the Administration Portal and is accessed via the REST API. This text field has a 40-character limit and must be a unique name within the data center with any combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores. The name can be reused in different data centers in the environment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Description</b></td>
  <td>A description of the template. This field is recommended but not mandatory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Comment</b></td>
  <td>A field for adding plain text, human-readable comments regarding the template.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Cluster</b></td>
  <td>The cluster with which the template is associated. This is the same as the original virtual machines by default. You can select any cluster in the data center.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>CPU Profile</b></td>
  <td>The CPU profile assigned to the template. CPU profiles define the maximum amount of processing capability a virtual machine can access on the host on which it runs, expressed as a percent of the total processing capability available to that host. CPU profiles are defined on the cluster level based on quality of service entries created for data centers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Create as a Template Sub-Version</b></td>
  <td>
    <p>Specifies whether the template is created as a new version of an existing template. Select this check box to access the settings for configuring this option.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Root Template</b>: The template under which the sub-template is added.</li>
      <li><b>Sub-Version Name</b>: The name of the template. This is the name by which the template is accessed when creating a new virtual machine based on the template. If the virtual machine is stateless, the list of sub-versions will contain a <b>latest</b> option rather than the name of the latest sub-version. This option automatically applies the latest template sub-version to the virtual machine upon reboot. Sub-versions are particularly useful when working with pools of stateless virtual machines.</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Disks Allocation</b></td>
  <td>
    <p><b>Alias</b> - An alias for the virtual disk used by the template. By default, the alias is set to the same value as that of the source virtual machine.</p>
    <p><b>Virtual Size</b> - The total amount of disk space that a virtual machine based on the template can use. This value cannot be edited, and is provided for reference only. This value corresponds with the size, in GB, that was specified when the disk was created or edited.</p>
    <p><b>Format</b> - The format of the virtual disk used by the template. The available options are QCOW2 and Raw. By default, the format is set to Raw.</p>
    <p><b>Target</b> - The storage domain on which the virtual disk used by the template is stored. By default, the storage domain is set to the same value as that of the source virtual machine. You can select any storage domain in the cluster.</p>
    <p><b>Disk Profile</b> - The disk profile to assign to the virtual disk used by the template. Disk profiles are created based on storage profiles defined in the data centers.</p>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Allow all users to access this Template</b></td>
  <td>Specifies whether a template is public or private. A public template can be accessed by all users, whereas a private template can only be accessed by users with the <b>TemplateAdmin</b> or <b>SuperUser</b> roles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Copy VM permissions</b></td>
  <td>Copies explicit permissions that have been set on the source virtual machine to the template.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Seal Template</b> (Linux only)</td>
  <td>Specifies whether a template is sealed. 'Sealing' is an operation that erases all machine-specific configurations from a filesystem, including SSH keys, UDEV rules, MAC addresses, system ID, and hostname. This setting prevents a virtual machine based on this template from inheriting the configuration of the source virtual machine.</td>
