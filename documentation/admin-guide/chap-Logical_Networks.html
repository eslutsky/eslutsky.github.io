<h2 id="logical-network-tasks">Logical Network Tasks</h2>

<h3 id="performing-networking-tasks">Performing Networking Tasks</h3>

<p><strong>Network</strong> → <strong>Networks</strong> provides a central location for users to perform logical network-related operations and search for logical networks based on each network’s property or association with other resources.The <strong>New</strong>, <strong>Edit</strong> and <strong>Remove</strong> buttons allow you to create, change the properties of, and delete logical networks within data centers.</p>

<p>Click on each network name and use the tabs in the details view to perform functions including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Attaching or detaching the networks to clusters and hosts</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Removing network interfaces from virtual machines and templates</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adding and removing permissions for users to access and manage networks</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These functions are also accessible through each individual resource tab.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Do not change networking in a data center or a cluster if any hosts are running as this risks making the host unreachable.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> If you plan to use oVirt nodes to provide any services, remember that the services will stop if the oVirt environment stops operating.</p>

<p>This applies to all services, but you should be especially aware of the hazards of running the following on oVirt:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Directory Services</li>
  <li>DNS</li>
  <li>Storage</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="creating-a-new-logical-network-in-a-data-center-or-cluster">Creating a New Logical Network in a Data Center or Cluster</h3>

<p>Create a logical network and define its use in a data center, or in clusters in a data center.</p>

<p><strong>Creating a New Logical Network in a Data Center or Cluster</strong></p>

  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Compute</strong> → <strong>Data Centers</strong> or <strong>Compute</strong> → <strong>Clusters</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the data center or cluster name to open the details view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Logical Networks</strong> tab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open the <strong>New Logical Network</strong> window:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>From the <strong>Data Centers</strong> details pane, click <strong>New</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>From the <strong>Clusters</strong> details pane, click <strong>Add Network</strong>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter a <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>Description</strong>, and <strong>Comment</strong> for the logical network.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optionally enable <strong>Enable VLAN tagging</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optionally disable <strong>VM Network</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optionally select the <strong>Create on external provider</strong> check box. This disables the <strong>Network Label</strong>, <strong>VM Network</strong>, and <strong>MTU</strong> options.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the <strong>External Provider</strong>. The <strong>External Provider</strong> list does not include external providers that are in read-only mode.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can create an internal, isolated network, by selecting <strong>ovirt-provider-ovn</strong> on the <strong>External Provider</strong> list and leaving <strong>Connect to physical network</strong> unselected.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Enter a new label or select an existing label for the logical network in the <strong>Network Label</strong> text field.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set the <strong>MTU</strong> value to <strong>Default (1500)</strong> or <strong>Custom</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the <strong>Cluster</strong> tab, select the clusters to which the network will be assigned. You can also specify whether the logical network will be a required network.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <strong>Create on external provider</strong> is selected, the <strong>Subnet</strong> tab will be visible. From the <strong>Subnet</strong> tab, select the <strong>Create subnet</strong> and enter a <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>CIDR</strong>, and <strong>Gateway</strong> address, and select an <strong>IP Version</strong> for the subnet that the logical network will provide. You can also add DNS servers as required.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the <strong>vNIC Profiles</strong> tab, add vNIC profiles to the logical network as required.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you entered a label for the logical network, it is automatically added to all host network interfaces with that label.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When creating a new logical network or making changes to an existing logical network that is used as a display network, any running virtual machines that use that network must be rebooted before the network becomes available or the changes are applied.</p>

<h3 id="editing-a-logical-network">Editing a Logical Network</h3>

<p>Edit the settings of a logical network.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> A logical network cannot be edited or moved to another interface if it is not synchronized with the network configuration on the host. See <a href="Editing_host_network_interfaces">Editing host network interfaces</a> on how to synchronize your networks.</p>

<p><strong>Editing a Logical Network</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Compute</strong> → <strong>Data Centers</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the data center’s name to open the details view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Logical Networks</strong> tab and select a logical network.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Edit</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Edit the necessary settings.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can edit the name of a new or existing network, with the exception of the default network, without having to stop the virtual machines.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Multi-host network configuration automatically applies updated network settings to all of the hosts within the data center to which the network is assigned. Changes can only be applied when virtual machines using the network are down. You cannot rename a logical network that is already configured on a host. You cannot disable the <strong>VM Network</strong> option while virtual machines or templates using that network are running.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="removing-a-logical-network">Removing a Logical Network</h3>

<p>You can remove a logical network from <strong>Network</strong> → <strong>Networks</strong> or <strong>Compute</strong> → <strong>Data Centers</strong>.  The following procedure shows you how to remove logical networks associated to a data center. For a working oVirt environment, you must have at least one logical network used as the <code>ovirtmgmt</code> management network.</p>

<p><strong>Removing Logical Networks</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Compute</strong> → <strong>Data Centers</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the data center’s name to open the details view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Logical Networks</strong> tab to list the logical networks in the data center.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select a logical network and click <strong>Remove</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optionally, select the <strong>Remove external network(s) from the provider(s) as well</strong> check box to remove the logical network both from the Manager and from the external provider if the network is provided by an external provider. The check box is grayed out if the external provider is in read-only mode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The logical network is removed from the Engine and is no longer available.</p>

<h3 id="configuring-a-non-management-logical-network-as-the-default-route">Configuring a Non-Management Logical Network as the Default Route</h3>

<p>The default route used by hosts in a cluster is through the management network (ovirtmgmt). The following procedure provides instructions to configure a non-management logical network as the default route.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If you are using the default_route custom property, you need to clear the custom property from all attached hosts and then follow this procedure.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Configuring the Default Route Role</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Network</strong> → <strong>Networks</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the name of the non-management logical network to configure as the default route to access its details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Clusters</strong> tab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Manage Network</strong> to open the <strong>Manage Network</strong> window.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the <strong>Default Route</strong> checkbox for the appropriate cluster(s).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>When networks are attached to a host, the default route of the host will be set on the network of your choice. It is recommended to configure the default route role before any host is added to your cluster. If your cluster already contains hosts, they may become out-of-sync until you sync your change to them.</p>

<h3 id="viewing-or-editing-the-gateway-for-a-logical-network">Viewing or Editing the Gateway for a Logical Network</h3>

<p>Users can define the gateway, along with the IP address and subnet mask, for a logical network. This is necessary when multiple networks exist on a host and traffic should be routed through the specified network, rather than the default gateway.</p>

<p>If multiple networks exist on a host and the gateways are not defined, return traffic will be routed through the default gateway, which may not reach the intended destination. This would result in users being unable to ping the host.
<a href="/develop/release-management/features/network/multiple-gateways/">Multiple Gateways</a>.</p>

<p>oVirt handles multiple gateways automatically whenever an interface goes up or down.</p>

<p><strong>Viewing or Editing the Gateway for a Logical Network</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Compute</strong> → <strong>Hosts</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the host’s name to open the details view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Network Interfaces</strong> tab to list the network interfaces attached to the host and their configurations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Setup Host Networks</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hover your cursor over an assigned logical network and click the pencil icon to open the <strong>Edit Management Network</strong> window.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The <strong>Edit Management Network</strong> window displays the network name, the boot protocol, and the IP, subnet mask, and gateway addresses. The address information can be manually edited by selecting a <strong>Static</strong> boot protocol.</p>

<h3 id="editing-the-virtual-function-configuration-on-a-nic">Editing the Virtual Function Configuration on a NIC</h3>

<p>Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) enables a single PCIe endpoint to be used as multiple separate devices. This is achieved through the introduction of two PCIe functions: physical functions (PFs) and virtual functions (VFs). A PCIe card can have between one and eight PFs, but each PF can support many more VFs (dependent on the device).</p>

<p>You can edit the configuration of SR-IOV-capable Network Interface Controllers (NICs) through the oVirt Engine, including the number of VFs on each NIC and to specify the virtual networks allowed to access the VFs.</p>

<p>Once VFs have been created, each can be treated as a standalone NIC. This includes having one or more logical networks assigned to them, creating bonded interfaces with them, and to directly assign vNICs to them for direct device passthrough.</p>

<p>A vNIC must have the passthrough property enabled in order to be directly attached to a VF. See <a href="Marking_vNIC_as_Passthrough">Marking vNIC as Passthrough</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Editing the Virtual Function Configuration on a NIC</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Compute</strong> → <strong>Hosts</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the name of an SR-IOV-capable host to open the details view.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To edit the number of virtual functions, click the <strong>Number of VFs setting</strong> drop-down button and edit the <strong>Number of VFs</strong> text field.</p>

    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Changing the number of VFs will delete all previous VFs on the network interface before creating new VFs. This includes any VFs that have virtual machines directly attached.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>All Networks</strong> check box is selected by default, allowing all networks to access the virtual functions. To specify the virtual networks allowed to access the virtual functions, select the <strong>Specific networks</strong> radio button to list all networks. You can then either select the check box for desired networks, or you can use the <strong>Labels</strong> text field to automatically select networks based on one or more network labels.</p>

<h2 id="virtual-network-interface-cards">Virtual Network Interface Cards</h2>

<h3 id="vnic-profile-overview">vNIC Profile Overview</h3>

<p>A Virtual Network Interface Card (vNIC) profile is a collection of settings that can be applied to individual virtual network interface cards in the Manager. A vNIC profile allows you to apply Network QoS profiles to a vNIC, enable or disable port mirroring, and add or remove custom properties. A vNIC profile also offers an added layer of administrative flexibility in that permission to use (consume) these profiles can be granted to specific users. In this way, you can control the quality of service that different users receive from a given network.</p>

<h3 id="creating-or-editing-a-vnic-profile">Creating or Editing a vNIC Profile</h3>

<p>Create or edit a Virtual Network Interface Controller (vNIC) profile to regulate network bandwidth for users and groups.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are enabling or disabling port mirroring, all virtual machines using the associated profile must be in a down state before editing.</p>

<h3 id="enabling-passthrough-on-a-vnic-profile">Enabling Passthrough on a vNIC Profile</h3>

<p>The passthrough property of a vNIC profile enables a vNIC to be directly connected to a virtual function (VF) of an SR-IOV-enabled NIC. The vNIC will then bypass the software network virtualization and connect directly to the VF for direct device assignment.</p>

<p>The passthrough property cannot be enabled if the vNIC profile is already attached to a vNIC; this procedure creates a new profile to avoid this. If a vNIC profile has passthrough enabled, QoS and port mirroring are disabled for the profile.</p>

<p><strong>Enabling Passthrough</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Network</strong> → <strong>Networks</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the logical network’s name to open the details view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>vNIC Profiles</strong> tab to list all vNIC profiles for that logical network.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>New</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter the <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Description</strong> of the profile.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the <strong>Passthrough</strong> check box.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optionally deselect the <strong>Migratable</strong> check box to disable migration for vNICs using this profile.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If necessary, select a custom property from the custom properties list, which displays <strong>Please select a key…</strong> by default. Use the <strong>+</strong> and <strong>-</strong> buttons to add or remove custom properties.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The vNIC profile is now passthrough-capable. To use this profile to directly attach a virtual machine to a NIC or PCI VF, attach the logical network to the NIC and create a new vNIC on the desired virtual machine that uses the passthrough vNIC profile. For more information on these procedures respectively, see "Editing host network interfaces" and "Adding a New Network Interface" in the <a href="/documentation/vmm-guide/Virtual_Machine_Management_Guide/">Virtual Machine Management Guide</a>.</p>

<h3 id="assigning-security-groups-to-vnic-profiles">Assigning Security Groups to vNIC Profiles</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This feature is only available for users who are integrating with OpenStack Neutron. Security groups cannot be created with oVirt Engine. You must create security groups within OpenStack.</p>

<p>You can assign security groups to the vNIC profile of networks that have been imported from an OpenStack Networking instance and that use the Open vSwitch plug-in. A security group is a collection of strictly enforced rules that allow you to filter inbound and outbound traffic over a network interface. The following procedure outlines how to attach a security group to a vNIC profile.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> A security group is identified using the ID of that security group as registered in the OpenStack Networking instance. You can find the IDs of security groups for a given tenant by running the following command on the system on which OpenStack Networking is installed:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>    # neutron security-group-list&#x000A;</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Assigning Security Groups to vNIC Profiles</strong></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the custom properties drop-down list, select <strong>SecurityGroups</strong>. Leaving the custom property drop-down blank applies the default security settings, which permit all outbound traffic and intercommunication but deny all inbound traffic from outside of the default security group. Note that removing the <strong>SecurityGroups</strong> property later will not affect the applied security group.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the text field, enter the ID of the security group to attach to the vNIC profile.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You have attached a security group to the vNIC profile. All traffic through the logical network to which that profile is attached will be filtered in accordance with the rules defined for that security group.</p>

<h3 id="user-permissions-for-vnic-profiles">User Permissions for vNIC Profiles</h3>

<h3 id="configuring-vnic-profiles-for-ucs-integration">Configuring vNIC Profiles for UCS Integration</h3>

<p>Cisco's Unified Computing System (UCS) is used to manage datacenter aspects such as computing, networking and storage resources.</p>

<p>The <code>vdsm-hook-vmfex-dev</code> hook allows virtual machines to connect to Cisco's UCS-defined port profiles by configuring the vNIC profile. The UCS-defined port profiles contain the properties and settings used to configure virtual interfaces in UCS. The <code>vdsm-hook-vmfex-dev</code> hook is installed by default with VDSM. See <a href="appe-VDSM_and_Hooks">VDSM and Hooks</a> for more information.</p>

<p>When a virtual machine that uses the vNIC profile is created, it will use the Cisco vNIC.</p>

<p>The procedure to configure the vNIC profile for UCS integration involves first configuring a custom device property. When configuring the custom device property, any existing value it contained is overwritten. When combining new and existing custom properties, include all of the custom properties in the command used to set the key's value. Multiple custom properties are separated by a semi-colon.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> A UCS port profile must be configured in Cisco UCS before configuring the vNIC profile.</p>

<p><strong>Configuring the Custom Device Property</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>On the oVirt Engine, configure the <code>vmfex</code> custom property and set the cluster compatibility level using <code>--cver</code>.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code> # engine-config -s CustomDeviceProperties='{type=interface;prop={vmfex=^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]{2,32}$}}' --cver=3.6&#x000A;</code></pre></div>  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Verify that the <code>vmfex</code> custom device property was added.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code> # engine-config -g CustomDeviceProperties&#x000A;</code></pre></div>  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Restart the engine.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code> # systemctl restart ovirt-engine.service&#x000A;</code></pre></div>  </li>
</ol>

<p>The vNIC profile to configure can belong to a new or existing logical network. See <a href="Creating_a_new_logical_network_in_a_data_center_or_cluster">Creating a new logical network in a data center or cluster</a> for instructions to configure a new logical network.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Network</strong> → <strong>Networks</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Import</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the <strong>Network Provider</strong> drop-down list, select an external provider. The networks offered by that provider are automatically discovered and listed in the <strong>Provider Networks</strong> list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using the check boxes, select the networks to import in the <strong>Provider Networks</strong> list and click the down arrow to move those networks into the <strong>Networks to Import</strong> list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p>The selected networks are imported into the target data center and can be attached to virtual machines. See "Adding a New Network Interface" in the <a href="/documentation/vmm-guide/Virtual_Machine_Management_Guide/">Virtual Machine Management Guide</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="limitations-to-using-external-provider-networks">Limitations to Using External Provider Networks</h3>

<p>The following limitations apply to using logical networks imported from an external provider in an oVirt environment.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Logical networks offered by external providers must be used as virtual machine networks, and cannot be used as display networks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same logical network can be imported more than once, but only to different data centers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You cannot edit logical networks offered by external providers in the Manager. To edit the details of a logical network offered by an external provider, you must edit the logical network directly from the external provider that provides that logical network.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Port mirroring is not available for virtual network interface cards connected to logical networks offered by external providers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a virtual machine uses a logical network offered by an external provider, that provider cannot be deleted from the Manager while the logical network is still in use by the virtual machine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Networks offered by external providers are non-required. As such, scheduling for clusters in which such logical networks have been imported will not take those logical networks into account during host selection. Moreover, it is the responsibility of the user to ensure the availability of the logical network on hosts in clusters in which such logical networks have been imported.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="configuring-subnets-on-external-provider-logical-networks">Configuring Subnets on External Provider Logical Networks</h3>

<p>A logical network provided by an external provider can only assign IP addresses to virtual machines if one or more subnets have been defined on that logical network. If no subnets are defined, virtual machines will not be assigned IP addresses. If there is one subnet, virtual machines will be assigned an IP address from that subnet, and if there are multiple subnets, virtual machines will be assigned an IP address from any of the available subnets. The DHCP service provided by the external network provider on which the logical network is hosted is responsible for assigning these IP addresses.</p>

<p>While the oVirt Engine automatically discovers predefined subnets on imported logical networks, you can also add or remove subnets to or from logical networks from within the Manager.</p>

<h3 id="editing-host-network-interfaces-and-assigning-logical-networks-to-hosts">Editing Host Network Interfaces and Assigning Logical Networks to Hosts</h3>

<p>You can change the settings of physical host network interfaces, move the management network from one physical host network interface to another, and assign logical networks to physical host network interfaces. Bridge and ethtool custom properties are also supported.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> The only way to change the IP address of a host in Red Hat Virtualization is to remove the host and then to add it again.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> You cannot assign logical networks offered by external providers to physical host network interfaces; such networks are dynamically assigned to hosts as they are required by virtual machines.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the switch has been configured to provide Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) information, you can hover your cursor over a physical network interface to view the switch port’s current configuration. This can help to prevent incorrect configuration. Red Hat recommends checking the following information prior to assigning logical networks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Port Description (TLV type 4)</strong> and <strong>System Name (TLV type 5)</strong> help to detect to which ports and on which switch the host’s interfaces are patched.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Port VLAN ID</strong> shows the native VLAN ID configured on the switch port for untagged ethernet frames. All VLANs configured on the switch port are shown as <strong>VLAN Name</strong> and <strong>VLAN ID</strong> combinations.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attach a logical network to a physical host network interface by selecting and dragging the logical network into the <strong>Assigned Logical Networks</strong> area next to the physical host network interface.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, right-click the logical network and select a network interface from the drop-down menu.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Configure the logical network:</p>

    <p>i. Hover your cursor over an assigned logical network and click the pencil icon to open the <strong>Edit Management Network</strong> window.</p>

    <p>ii. From the <strong>IPv4</strong> tab, select a <strong>Boot Protocol</strong> from <strong>None</strong>, <strong>DHCP</strong>, or <strong>Static</strong>. If you selected <strong>Static</strong>, enter the <strong>IP</strong>, <strong>Netmask / Routing Prefix</strong>, and the <strong>Gateway</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Each logical network can have a separate gateway defined from the management network gateway. This ensures traffic that arrives on the logical network will be forwarded using the logical network's gateway instead of the default gateway used by the management network.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>IPv6</strong> tab should not be used as it is currently not supported.</p>

    <p>iii. Use the <strong>QoS</strong> tab to override the default host network quality of service. Select <strong>Override QoS</strong> and enter the desired values in the following fields:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Weighted Share</strong>: Signifies how much of the logical link's capacity a specific network should be allocated, relative to the other networks attached to the same logical link. The exact share depends on the sum of shares of all networks on that link. By default this is a number in the range 1-100.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Rate Limit [Mbps]</strong>: The maximum bandwidth to be used by a network.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Committed Rate [Mbps]</strong>: The minimum bandwidth required by a network. The Committed Rate requested is not guaranteed and will vary depending on the network infrastructure and the Committed Rate requested by other networks on the same logical link.</p>

    <p>vi. To configure Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), click the <strong>Custom Properties</strong> tab and select <strong>fcoe</strong> from the drop-down list. Enter a valid key and value with the following syntax: <code>key=value</code>. At least <code>enable=yes</code> is required. You can also add <code>dcb=[yes|no]</code> and <code>auto_vlan=[yes|no]</code>. Separate multiple entries with a whitespace character. The <strong>fcoe</strong> option is not available by default; you need to add it using the engine configuration tool. See <a href="How_to_Set_Up_RHVM_to_Use_FCoE">How to Set Up RHVM to Use FCoE</a> for more information.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> A separate, dedicated logical network is recommended for use with FCoE.</p>

    <p>vii. To change the default network used by the host from the management network (ovirtmgmt) to a non-management network, configure the non-management network’s default route.</p>

    <p>viii. If your logical network definition is not synchronized with the network configuration on the host, select the <strong>Sync network</strong> check box.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the <strong>Verify connectivity between Host and Engine</strong> check box to check network connectivity; this action will only work if the host is in maintenance mode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the <strong>Save network configuration</strong> check box to make the changes persistent when the environment is rebooted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If not all network interface cards for the host are displayed, click <strong>Management</strong> → <strong>Refresh Capabilities</strong> button to update the list of network interface cards available for that host.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="synchronizing-host-networks">Synchronizing Host Networks</h3>

<p>The Manager defines a network interface as out-of-sync when the definition of the interface on the host differs from the definitions stored by the Manager. Out-of-sync networks appear with an Out-of-sync icon <img alt="" width="17" height="23" src="/images/admin-guide/out-of-sync.png?1560777613" /> out of sync in the host’s <strong>Network Interfaces</strong> tab and with this icon <img alt="" width="19" height="18" src="/images/admin-guide/out-of-sync-setup.png?1560777613" /> out of sync setup in the <strong>Setup Host Networks</strong> window.</p>

<p>When a host’s network is out of sync, the only activities that you can perform on the unsynchronized network in the <strong>Setup Host Networks</strong> window are detaching the logical network from the network interface or synchronizing the network.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding How a Host Becomes out-of-sync</strong></p>

<p>A host will become out of sync if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You make configuration changes on the host rather than using the <strong>Edit Logical Networks</strong> window, for example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Changing the VLAN identifier on the physical host.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Changing the <strong>Custom MTU</strong> on the physical host.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You move a host to a different data center with the same network name, but with different values/parameters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You change a network’s <strong>VM Network</strong> property by manually removing the bridge from the host.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You update definitions using the <strong>Edit Logical Networks</strong> window, without selecting the <strong>Save network configuration</strong> check box when saving your changes. After rebooting the host, it may become unsynchronized.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Preventing Hosts from Becoming Unsynchronized</strong></p>

<p>Following these best practices will prevent your host from becoming unsynchronized:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that the <strong>Save network configuration</strong> check box is selected when saving your changes in the <strong>Edit Logical Networks</strong> window (it is selected by default).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the Administration Portal to make changes rather than making changes locally on the host.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Edit VLAN settings according to the instructions in the “Editing a Host’s VLAN Settings” section.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Synchronizing Hosts</strong></p>

<p>Synchronizing a host’s network interface definitions involves using the definitions from the Manager and applying them to the host. If these are not the definitions that you require, after synchronizing your hosts update their definitions from the Administration Portal. You can synchronize a host’s networks on three levels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Per logical network</li>
  <li>Per host</li>
  <li>Per cluster</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Synchronizing Host Networks on the Logical Network Level</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Compute</strong> → <strong>Hosts</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the host’s name to open the details view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Network Interfaces</strong> tab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Setup Host Networks</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hover your cursor over the unsynchronized network and click the pencil icon to open the <strong>Edit Network</strong> window.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the <strong>Sync network</strong> check box.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the <strong>Save network configuration</strong> check box in the <strong>Setup Host Networks</strong> window to make the changes persistent when the environment is rebooted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Synchronizing a Host’s Networks on the Host level</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the <strong>Sync All Networks</strong> button in the host’s <strong>Network Interfaces</strong> tab to synchronize all of the host’s unsynchronized network interfaces.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Synchronizing a Host’s Networks on the Cluster level</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Sync All Networks</strong> button in the cluster’s <strong>Logical Networks</strong> tab to synchronize all unsynchronized logical network definitions for the entire cluster.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can also synchronize a host’s networks via the REST API</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="editing-a-hosts-vlan-settings">Editing a Host’s VLAN Settings</h3>

<p>To change the VLAN settings of a host, the host must be removed from the Manager, reconfigured, and re-added to the engine.</p>

<p>To keep networking synchronized, do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Put the host in maintenance mode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Manually remove the management network from the host. This will make the host reachable over the new VLAN.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add the host to the cluster. Virtual machines that are not connected directly to the management network can be migrated between hosts safely.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The following warning message appears when the VLAN ID of the management network is changed:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>    Changing certain properties (e.g. VLAN, MTU) of the management network could lead to loss of connectivity to hosts in the data center, if its underlying network infrastructure isn't configured to accommodate the changes. Are you sure you want to proceed?&#x000A;</code></pre></div>
<p>Proceeding causes all of the hosts in the data center to lose connectivity to the Manager and causes the migration of hosts to the new management network to fail. The management network will be reported as "out-of-sync".</p>

<h3 id="adding-multiple-vlans-to-a-single-network-interface-using-logical-networks">Adding Multiple VLANs to a Single Network Interface Using Logical Networks</h3>

<p>Multiple VLANs can be added to a single network interface to separate traffic on the one host.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> You must have created more than one logical network, all with the <strong>Enable VLAN tagging</strong> check box selected in the <strong>New Logical Network</strong> or <strong>Edit Logical Network</strong> windows.</p>

<p><strong>Adding Multiple VLANs to a Network Interface using Logical Networks</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Compute</strong> → <strong>Hosts</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the host’s name to open the details view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Network Interfaces</strong> tab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Setup Host Networks</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Drag your VLAN-tagged logical networks into the <strong>Assigned Logical Networks</strong> area next to the physical network interface. The physical network interface can have multiple logical networks assigned due to the VLAN tagging.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Edit the logical networks:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>i. Hover your cursor over an assigned logical network and click the pencil icon.</p>

<p>ii. If your logical network definition is not synchronized with the network configuration on the host, select the <strong>Sync network</strong> check box.</p>

<p>iii. Select a <strong>Boot Protocol</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>None</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DHCP</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Static</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>iv. Provide the <strong>IP</strong> and <strong>Subnet Mask</strong>.</p>

<p>v. Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Select the <strong>Verify connectivity between Host and Engine</strong> check box to run a network check; this will only work if the host is in maintenance mode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the <strong>Save network configuration</strong> check box.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Add the logical network to each host in the cluster by editing a NIC on each host in the cluster. After this is done, the network will become operational.</p>

<p>You have added multiple VLAN-tagged logical networks to a single interface. This process can be repeated multiple times, selecting and editing the same network interface each time on each host to add logical networks with different VLAN tags to a single network interface.</p>

<h3 id="assigning-additional-ipv4-addresses-to-a-host-network">Assigning Additional IPv4 Addresses to a Host Network</h3>

<p>A host network, such as the <strong>ovirtmgmt</strong> management network, is created with only one IP address when initially set up. This means that if a NIC’s configuration file (for example, <strong>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth01</strong>) is configured with multiple IP addresses, only the first listed IP address will be assigned to the host network. Additional IP addresses may be required if connecting to storage, or to a server on a separate private subnet using the same NIC.</p>

<p>The <code>vdsm-hook-extra-ipv4-addrs</code> hook allows you to configure additional IPv4 addresses for host networks. For more information about hooks, see Appendix A, VDSM and Hooks.</p>

<p>In the following procedure, the host-specific tasks must be performed on each host for which you want to configure additional IP addresses.</p>

<p><strong>Assigning Additional IPv4 Addresses to a Host Network</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>On the host that you want to configure additional IPv4 addresses for, install the VDSM hook package. The package is available by default on oVirt Nodes but needs to be installed on Enterprise Linux hosts.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code># yum install vdsm-hook-extra-ipv4-addrs&#x000A;</code></pre></div>  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the Engine, run the following command to add the key:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code># engine-config -s 'UserDefinedNetworkCustomProperties=ipv4_addrs=.\*'&#x000A;</code></pre></div>  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Restart the ovirt-engine service:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code># systemctl restart ovirt-engine.service&#x000A;</code></pre></div>  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Administration Portal, click <strong>Compute</strong> → <strong>Hosts</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the host’s name to open the details view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Network Interfaces</strong> tab and click <strong>Setup Host Networks</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Edit the host network interface by hovering the cursor over the assigned logical network and clicking the pencil icon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select <strong>ipv4_addr</strong> from the <strong>Custom Properties</strong> drop-down list and add the additional IP address and prefix (for example 5.5.5.5/24). Multiple IP addresses must be comma-separated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the <strong>Save network configuration</strong> check box.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The additional IP addresses will not be displayed in the Engine, but you can run the command <code>ip addr show</code> on the host to confirm that they have been added.</p>

<h3 id="adding-network-labels-to-host-network-interfaces">Adding Network Labels to Host Network Interfaces</h3>

<p>Using network labels allows you to greatly simplify the administrative workload associated with assigning logical networks to host network interfaces.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Setting a label on a role network (for instance, a migration network or a display network) causes a mass deployment of that network on all hosts. Such mass additions of networks are achieved through the use of DHCP. This method of mass deployment was chosen over a method of typing in static addresses, because of the unscalable nature of the task of typing in many static IP addresses.</p>

<p><strong>Adding Network Labels to Host Network Interfaces</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Compute</strong> → <strong>Hosts</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the host’s name to open the details view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Network Interfaces</strong> tab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Setup Host Networks</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Labels</strong>, and right-click <strong>[New Label]</strong>. Select a physical network interface to label.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter a name for the network label in the <strong>Label</strong> text field.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You have added a network label to a host network interface. Any newly created logical networks with the same label will be automatically assigned to all host network interfaces with that label. Also, removing a label from a logical network will automatically remove that logical network from all host network interfaces with that label.</p>

<h3 id="bonding-logic-in-ovirt">Bonding Logic in oVirt</h3>

<p>The oVirt Engine Administration Portal allows you to create bond devices using a graphical interface. There are several distinct bond creation scenarios, each with its own logic.</p>

<p>Two factors that affect bonding logic are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Are either of the devices already carrying logical networks?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are the devices carrying compatible logical networks?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bonding Scenarios and Their Results</strong></p>

<h3 id="bonding-modes">Bonding Modes</h3>

<p>A bond is an aggregation of multiple network interface cards into a single software-defined device. Because bonded network interfaces combine the transmission capability of the network interface cards included in the bond to act as a single network interface, they can provide greater transmission speed than that of a single network interface card. Also, because all network interface cards in the bond must fail for the bond itself to fail, bonding provides increased fault tolerance. However, one limitation is that the network interface cards that form a bonded network interface must be of the same make and model to ensure that all network interface cards in the bond support the same options and modes.</p>

<p>The packet dispersal algorithm for a bond is determined by the bonding mode used.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Modes 1, 2, 3, and 4 support both virtual machine (bridged) and non-virtual machine (bridgeless) network types. Modes 0, 5 and 6 support non-virtual machine (bridgeless) networks only.</p>

<p>oVirt uses Mode 4 by default, but supports the following common bonding modes:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Mode 0 (round-robin policy)</strong></dt>
  <dd>Transmits packets through network interface cards in sequential order. Packets are transmitted in a loop that begins with the first available network interface card in the bond and end with the last available network interface card in the bond. All subsequent loops then start with the first available network interface card. Mode 0 offers fault tolerance and balances the load across all network interface cards in the bond. However, Mode 0 cannot be used in conjunction with bridges, and is therefore not compatible with virtual machine logical networks.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Mode 1 (active-backup policy)</strong></dt>
  <dd>Sets all network interface cards to a backup state while one network interface card remains active. In the event of failure in the active network interface card, one of the backup network interface cards replaces that network interface card as the only active network interface card in the bond. The MAC address of the bond in Mode 1 is visible on only one port to prevent any confusion that might otherwise be caused if the MAC address of the bond changed to reflect that of the active network interface card. Mode 1 provides fault tolerance and is supported in oVirt.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Mode 2 (XOR policy)</strong></dt>
  <dd>Selects the network interface card through which to transmit packets based on the result of an XOR operation on the source and destination MAC addresses modulo network interface card slave count. This calculation ensures that the same network interface card is selected for each destination MAC address used. Mode 2 provides fault tolerance and load balancing and is supported in oVirt.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Mode 3 (broadcast policy)</strong></dt>
  <dd>Transmits all packets to all network interface cards. Mode 3 provides fault tolerance and is supported in oVirt.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Mode 4 (IEEE 802.3ad policy)</strong></dt>
  <dd>Creates aggregation groups in which the interfaces share the same speed and duplex settings. Mode 4 uses all network interface cards in the active aggregation group in accordance with the IEEE 802.3ad specification and is supported in oVirt.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Mode 5 (adaptive transmit load balancing policy)</strong></dt>
  <dd>Ensures the distribution of outgoing traffic accounts for the load on each network interface card in the bond and that the current network interface card receives all incoming traffic. If the network interface card assigned to receive traffic fails, another network interface card is assigned to the role of receiving incoming traffic. Mode 5 cannot be used in conjunction with bridges, therefore it is not compatible with virtual machine logical networks.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Mode 6 (adaptive load balancing policy)</strong></dt>
  <dd>Combines Mode 5 (adaptive transmit load balancing policy) with receive load balancing for IPv4 traffic without any special switch requirements. ARP negotiation is used for balancing the receive load. Mode 6 cannot be used in conjunction with bridges, therefore it is not compatible with virtual machine logical networks.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="creating-a-bond-device-using-the-administration-portal">Creating a Bond Device Using the Administration Portal</h3>

<p>You can bond compatible network devices together. This type of configuration can increase available bandwidth and reliability. You can bond multiple network interfaces, pre-existing bond devices, and combinations of the two. A bond can carry both VLAN tagged and non-VLAN traffic.</p>

<p><strong>Creating a Bond Device using the Administration Portal</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Compute</strong> → <strong>Hosts</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the host’s name to open the details view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Network Interfaces</strong> tab to list the physical network interfaces attached to the host.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Setup Host Networks</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optionally, hover your cursor over host network interface to view configuration information provided by the switch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select and drag one of the devices over the top of another device and drop it to open the <strong>Create New Bond</strong> window. Alternatively, right-click the device and select another device from the drop-down menu.</p>

    <p>If the devices are incompatible, the bond operation fails and suggests how to correct the compatibility issue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the <strong>Bond Name</strong> and <strong>Bonding Mode</strong> from the drop-down menus.</p>

    <p>Bonding modes 1, 2, 4, and 5 can be selected. Any other mode can be configured using the <strong>Custom</strong> option.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong> to create the bond and close the <strong>Create New Bond</strong> window.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assign a logical network to the newly created bond device.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optionally choose to <strong>Verify connectivity between Host and Engine</strong> and <strong>Save network configuration</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Your network devices are linked into a bond device and can be edited as a single interface. The bond device is listed in the <strong>Network Interfaces</strong> tab of the details pane for the selected host.</p>

<p>Bonding must be enabled for the ports of the switch used by the host. The process by which bonding is enabled is slightly different for each switch; consult the manual provided by your switch vendor for detailed information on how to enable bonding.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For a bond in Mode 4, all slaves must be configured properly on the switch. If none of them is configured properly on the switch, the <code>ad_partner_mac</code> is reported as 00:00:00:00:00:00. The Manager will display a warning in the form of an exclamation mark icon on the bond in the <strong>Network Interfaces</strong> tab. No warning is provided if any of the slaves are up and running.</p>

<h3 id="example-uses-of-custom-bonding-options-with-host-interfaces">Example Uses of Custom Bonding Options with Host Interfaces</h3>

<p>You can create customized bond devices by selecting <strong>Custom</strong> from the <strong>Bonding Mode</strong> of the <strong>Create New Bond</strong> window. The following examples should be adapted for your needs. For a comprehensive list of bonding options and their descriptions, see the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt">Linux Ethernet Bonding Driver HOWTO</a> on Kernel.org.</p>

<p><strong>xmit_hash_policy</strong></p>

<p>This option defines the transmit load balancing policy for bonding modes 2 and 4. For example, if the majority of your traffic is between many different IP addresses, you may want to set a policy to balance by IP address. You can set this load-balancing policy by selecting a <strong>Custom</strong> bonding mode, and entering the following into the text field:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>mode=4 xmit_hash_policy=layer2+3&#x000A;</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>ARP Monitoring</strong></p>

<p>ARP monitor is useful for systems which can't or don't report link-state properly via ethtool. Set an <code>arp_interval</code> on the bond device of the host by selecting a <strong>Custom</strong> bonding mode, and entering the following into the text field:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>mode=1 arp_interval=1 arp_ip_target=192.168.0.2&#x000A;</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Primary</strong></p>

<p>You may want to designate a NIC with higher throughput as the primary interface in a bond device. Designate which NIC is primary by selecting a <strong>Custom</strong> bonding mode, and entering the following into the text field:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>mode=1 primary=eth0&#x000A;</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="changing-the-fqdn-of-a-host">Changing the FQDN of a Host</h3>
