<h1 id="chapter-10-virtual-disks">Chapter 10: Virtual Disks</h1>

<h2 id="understanding-virtual-machine-storage">Understanding Virtual Machine Storage</h2>

<p>oVirt supports three storage types: NFS, iSCSI and FCP.</p>

<p>In each type, a host known as the Storage Pool Manager (SPM) manages access between hosts and storage. The SPM host is the only node that has full access within the storage pool; the SPM can modify the storage domain metadata, and the pool's metadata. All other hosts can only access virtual machine hard disk image data.</p>

<p>By default in an NFS, local, or POSIX compliant data center, the SPM creates the virtual disk using a thin provisioned format as a file in a file system.</p>

<p>In iSCSI and other block-based data centers, the SPM creates a volume group on top of the Logical Unit Numbers (LUNs) provided, and makes logical volumes to use as virtual machine disks. Virtual machine disks on block-based storage are preallocated by default.</p>

<p>If the virtual disk is preallocated, a logical volume of the specified size in GB is created. The virtual machine can be mounted on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux server using <code>kpartx</code>, <code>vgscan</code>, <code>vgchange</code> or <code>mount</code> to investigate the virtual machine's processes or problems.</p>

<p>If the virtual disk is thinly provisioned, a 1 GB logical volume is created. The logical volume is continuously monitored by the host on which the virtual machine is running. As soon as the usage nears a threshold the host notifies the SPM, and the SPM extends the logical volume by 1 GB. The host is responsible for resuming the virtual machine after the logical volume has been extended. If the virtual machine goes into a paused state it means that the SPM could not extend the disk in time. This occurs if the SPM is too busy or if there is not enough storage space.</p>

<p>A virtual disk with a preallocated (RAW) format has significantly faster write speeds than a virtual disk with a thin provisioning (QCOW2) format. Thin provisioning takes significantly less time to create a virtual disk. The thin provision format is suitable for non-I/O intensive virtual machines. The preallocated format is recommended for virtual machines with high I/O writes. If a virtual machine is able to write more than 1 GB every four seconds, use preallocated disks where possible.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-virtual-disks">Understanding Virtual Disks</h2>

<p>oVirt features <strong>Preallocated</strong> (thick provisioned) and <strong>Sparse</strong> (thin provisioned) storage options.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Preallocated</p>

    <p>A preallocated virtual disk allocates all the storage required for a virtual machine up front. For example, a 20 GB preallocated logical volume created for the data partition of a virtual machine will take up 20 GB of storage space immediately upon creation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sparse</p>

    <p>A sparse allocation allows an administrator to define the total storage to be assigned to the virtual machine, but the storage is only allocated when required.</p>

    <p>For example, a 20 GB thin provisioned logical volume would take up 0 GB of storage space when first created. When the operating system is installed it may take up the size of the installed file, and would continue to grow as data is added up to a maximum of 20 GB size.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can view a virtual disk’s <strong>ID</strong> in <strong>Storage</strong> → <strong>Disks</strong>. The <strong>ID</strong> is used to identify a virtual disk because its device name (for example, <strong>/dev/vda0</strong>) can change, causing disk corruption. You can also view a virtual disk’s ID in <strong>/dev/disk/by-id</strong>.</p>

<p>You can view the <strong>Virtual Size</strong> of a disk in <strong>Storage</strong> → <strong>Disks</strong> and in the <strong>Disks</strong> tab of the details view for storage domains, virtual machines, and templates. The <strong>Virtual Size</strong> is the total amount of disk space that the virtual machine can use. It is the number that you enter in the <strong>Size(GB)</strong> field when you create or edit a virtual disk.</p>

<p>You can view the <strong>Actual Size</strong> of a disk in the <strong>Disks</strong> tab of the details view for storage domains and templates. This is the amount of disk space that has been allocated to the virtual machine so far. Preallocated disks show the same value for <strong>Virtual Size</strong> and <strong>Actual Size</strong>. Sparse disks may show different values, depending on how much disk space has been allocated.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>**Note:** When creating a Cinder virtual disk, the format and type of the disk are handled internally by Cinder and are not managed by oVirt.&#x000A;</code></pre></div>
<p>The possible combinations of storage types and formats are described in the following table.</p>

<h2 id="settings-to-wipe-virtual-disks-after-deletion">Settings to Wipe Virtual Disks After Deletion</h2>

<p>The <code>wipe_after_delete</code> flag, viewed in the Administration Portal as the <strong>Wipe After Delete</strong> check box will replace used data with zeros when a virtual disk is deleted. If it is set to false, which is the default, deleting the disk will open up those blocks for re-use but will not wipe the data. It is, therefore, possible for this data to be recovered because the blocks have not been returned to zero.</p>

<p>The <code>wipe_after_delete</code> flag only works on block storage. On file storage, for example NFS, the option does nothing because the file system will ensure that no data exists.</p>

<p>Enabling <code>wipe_after_delete</code> for virtual disks is more secure, and is recommended if the virtual disk has contained any sensitive data. This is a more intensive operation and users may experience degradation in performance and prolonged delete times.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>**Note:** The wipe after delete functionality is not the same as secure delete, and cannot guarantee that the data is removed from the storage, just that new disks created on same storage will not expose data from old disks.&#x000A;</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>wipe_after_delete</code> flag default can be changed to <code>true</code> during the setup process (see "Configuring the oVirt Engine" in the <a href="/documentation/install-guide/Installation_Guide/">Installation Guide</a>), or by using the engine configuration tool on the oVirt Engine. Restart the engine for the setting change to take effect.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>**Note:** Changing the `wipe_after_delete` flag’s default setting will not affect the **Wipe After Delete** property of disks that already exist.&#x000A;</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Setting SANWipeAfterDelete to Default to True Using the Engine Configuration Tool</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Run the <code>engine-config</code> tool with the <code>--set</code> action:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code> # engine-config --set SANWipeAfterDelete=true&#x000A;</code></pre></div>  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Restart the <code>ovirt-engine</code> for the change to take effect:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code> # systemctl restart ovirt-engine.service&#x000A;</code></pre></div>  </li>
</ol>

<p>The <strong>/var/log/vdsm/vdsm.log</strong> file located on the host can be checked to confirm that a virtual disk was successfully wiped and deleted.</p>

<p>For a successful wipe, the log file will contain the entry, <code>storage_domain_id/volume_id was zeroed and will be deleted</code>. For example:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>a9cb0625-d5dc-49ab-8ad1-72722e82b0bf/a49351a7-15d8-4932-8d67-512a369f9d61 was zeroed and will be deleted&#x000A;</code></pre></div>
<p>For a successful deletion, the log file will contain the entry, <code>finished with VG:storage_domain_id LVs: list_of_volume_ids, img: image_id</code>. For example:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>finished with VG:a9cb0625-d5dc-49ab-8ad1-72722e82b0bf LVs: {'a49351a7-15d8-4932-8d67-512a369f9d61': ImgsPar(imgs=['11f8b3be-fa96-4f6a-bb83-14c9b12b6e0d'], parent='00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000')}, img: 11f8b3be-fa96-4f6a-bb83-14c9b12b6e0d&#x000A;</code></pre></div>
<p>An unsuccessful wipe will display a log message <code>zeroing storage_domain_id/volume_id failed. Zero and remove this volume manually</code>, and an unsuccessful delete will display <code>Remove failed for some of VG: storage_domain_id zeroed volumes: list_of_volume_ids</code>.</p>

<h2 id="shareable-disks-in-ovirt">Shareable Disks in oVirt</h2>

<p>Some applications require storage to be shared between servers. oVirt allows you to mark virtual machine hard disks as <strong>Shareable</strong> and attach those disks to virtual machines. That way a single virtual disk can be used by multiple cluster-aware guests.</p>

<p>Shared disks are not to be used in every situation. For applications like clustered database servers, and other highly available services, shared disks are appropriate. Attaching a shared disk to multiple guests that are not cluster-aware is likely to cause data corruption because their reads and writes to the disk are not coordinated.</p>

<p>You cannot take a snapshot of a shared disk. Virtual disks that have snapshots taken of them cannot later be marked shareable.</p>

<p>You can mark a disk shareable either when you create it, or by editing the disk later.</p>

<h2 id="read-only-disks-in-ovirt">Read Only Disks in oVirt</h2>

<p>Some applications require administrators to share data with read-only rights. You can do this when creating or editing a disk attached to a virtual machine via the <strong>Disks</strong> tab in the details pane of the virtual machine and selecting the <strong>Read Only</strong> check box. That way, a single disk can be read by multiple cluster-aware guests, while an administrator maintains writing privileges.</p>

<p>You cannot change the read-only status of a disk while the virtual machine is running.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>**Important:** Mounting a journaled file system requires read-write access. Using the **Read Only** option is not appropriate for virtual machine disks that contain such file systems (e.g. `EXT3`, `EXT4`, or `XFS`).&#x000A;</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="virtual-disk-tasks">Virtual Disk Tasks</h2>

<h3 id="creating-floating-virtual-disks">Creating Floating Virtual Disks</h3>

<p><strong>Image</strong> disk creation is managed entirely by the Engine. <strong>Direct LUN</strong> disks require externally prepared targets that already exist. <strong>Cinder</strong> disks require access to an instance of OpenStack Volume that has been added to the oVirt environment using the <strong>External Providers</strong> window; see <a href="Adding_an_OpenStack_Volume_Cinder_Instance_for_Storage_Management">Adding an OpenStack Volume Cinder Instance for Storage Management</a> for more information.</p>

<p>You can create a virtual disk that is attached to a specific virtual machine. Additional options are available when creating an attached virtual disk, as specified in the “Explanation of Settings in the New Virtual Disk Window” section below.</p>

<p><strong>Creating a Virtual Disk Attached to a Virtual Machine</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Compute</strong> → <strong>Virtual Machines</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the virtual machine’s name to open the details view.</p>

<p>The <strong>Direct LUN</strong> settings can be displayed in either <strong>Targets &gt; LUNs</strong> or <strong>LUNs &gt; Targets</strong>. <strong>Targets &gt; LUNs</strong> sorts available LUNs according to the host on which they are discovered, whereas <strong>LUNs &gt; Targets</strong> displays a single list of LUNs.</p>

<p>Fill in the fields in the <strong>Discover Targets</strong> section and click <strong>Discover</strong> to discover the target server. You can then click the <strong>Login All</strong> button to list the available LUNs on the target server and, using the radio buttons next to each LUN, select the LUN to add.</p>

<p>Using LUNs directly as virtual machine hard disk images removes a layer of abstraction between your virtual machines and their data.</p>

<h3 id="overview-of-live-storage-migration">Overview of Live Storage Migration</h3>

<p>Virtual machine disks can be migrated from one storage domain to another while the virtual machine to which they are attached is running. This is referred to as live storage migration. When a disk attached to a running virtual machine is migrated, a snapshot of that disk's image chain is created in the source storage domain, and the entire image chain is replicated in the destination storage domain. As such, ensure that you have sufficient storage space in both the source storage domain and the destination storage domain to host both the disk image chain and the snapshot. A new snapshot is created on each live storage migration attempt, even when the migration fails.</p>

<p>Consider the following when using live storage migration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You can live migrate multiple disks at one time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Multiple disks for the same virtual machine can reside across more than one storage domain, but the image chain for each disk must reside on a single storage domain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can live migrate disks between any two storage domains in the same data center.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You cannot live migrate direct LUN hard disk images or disks marked as shareable.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="moving-a-virtual-disk">Moving a Virtual Disk</h3>

<p>Move a virtual disk that is attached to a virtual machine or acts as a floating virtual disk from one storage domain to another. You can move a virtual disk that is attached to a running virtual machine; this is referred to as live storage migration. Alternatively, shut down the virtual machine before continuing.</p>

<p>Consider the following when moving a disk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You can move multiple disks at the same time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can move disks between any two storage domains in the same data center.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the virtual disk is attached to a virtual machine that was created based on a template and used the thin provisioning storage allocation option, you must copy the disks for the template on which the virtual machine was based to the same storage domain as the virtual disk.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Moving a Virtual Disk</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Storage</strong> → <strong>Disks</strong> and select one or more virtual disks to move.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Move</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the <strong>Target</strong> list, select the storage domain to which the virtual disk(s) will be moved.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the <strong>Disk Profile</strong> list, select a profile for the disk(s), if applicable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The virtual disks are moved to the target storage domain. During the move procedure, the <strong>Status</strong> column displays <code>Locked</code> and a progress bar indicating the progress of the move operation.</p>

<h3 id="changing-the-disk-interface-type">Changing the Disk Interface Type</h3>

<p>Users can change a disk’s interface type after the disk has been created. This enables you to attach an existing disk to a virtual machine that requires a different interface type. For example, a disk using the <code>VirtIO</code> interface can be attached to a virtual machine requiring the <code>VirtIO-SCSI</code> or <code>IDE</code> interface. This provides flexibility to migrate disks for the purpose of backup and restore, or disaster recovery. The disk interface for shareable disks can also be updated per virtual machine. This means that each virtual machine that uses the shared disk can use a different interface type.</p>

<p>To update a disk interface type, all virtual machines using the disk must first be stopped.</p>

<p><strong>Changing a Disk Interface Type</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Compute</strong> → <strong>Virtual Machines</strong> and stop the appropriate virtual machine(s).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the virtual machine’s name to open the details view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Disks</strong> tab and select the disk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Edit</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the <strong>Interface</strong> list, select the new interface type and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can attach a disk to a different virtual machine that requires a different interface type.</p>

<p><strong>Attaching a Disk to a Different Virtual Machine using a Different Interface Type</strong></p>

<h3 id="exporting-a-virtual-machine-disk-to-an-openstack-image-service">Exporting a Virtual Machine Disk to an OpenStack Image Service</h3>

<p>Virtual machine disks can be exported to an OpenStack Image Service that has been added to the Engine as an external provider.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>**Important:** Virtual disks can only be exported if they do not have multiple volumes, are not thin provisioned, and do not have any snapshots.&#x000A;</code></pre></div>

  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="reclaiming-virtual-disk-space">Reclaiming Virtual Disk Space</h3>

<p>Virtual disks that use thin provisioning do not automatically shrink after deleting files from them. For example, if the actual disk size is 100GB and you delete 50GB of files, the allocated disk size remains at 100GB, and the remaining 50GB is not returned to the host, and therefore cannot be used by other virtual machines. This unused disk space can be reclaimed by the host by performing a sparsify operation on the virtual machine’s disks. This transfers the free space from the disk image to the host. You can sparsify multiple virtual disks in parallel.</p>

<p>The oVirt Project recommends performing this operation before cloning a virtual machine, creating a template based on a virtual machine, or cleaning up a storage domain’s disk space.</p>

<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>NFS storage domains must use NFS version 4.2 or higher.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You cannot sparsify a disk that uses a direct LUN or Cinder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You cannot sparsify a disk that uses a preallocated allocation policy. If you are creating a virtual machine from a template, you must select <strong>Thin</strong> from the <strong>Storage Allocation</strong> field, or if selecting <strong>Clone</strong>, ensure that the template is based on a virtual machine that has thin provisioning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can only sparsify active snapshots.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sparsifying a Disk</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Compute</strong> → <strong>Virtual Machines</strong> and shut down the required virtual machine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the virtual machine’s name to open the details view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Disks</strong> tab. Ensure that the disk’s status is <code>OK</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>More Actions</strong> → <strong>Sparsify</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>A <code>Started to sparsify</code> event appears in the <strong>Events</strong> tab during the sparsify operation and the disk’s status displays as <code>Locked</code>. When the operation is complete, a <code>Sparsified successfully</code> event appears in the <strong>Events</strong> tab and the disk’s status displays as <code>OK</code>. The unused disk space has been returned to the host and is available for use by other virtual machines.</p>
