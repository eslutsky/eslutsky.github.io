<h1 id="chapter-5-clusters">Chapter 5: Clusters</h1>

<h2 id="introduction-to-clusters">Introduction to Clusters</h2>

<p>A cluster is a logical grouping of hosts that share the same storage domains and have the same type of CPU (either Intel or AMD). If the hosts have different generations of CPU models, they use only the features present in all models.</p>

<p>Each cluster in the system must belong to a data center, and each host in the system must belong to a cluster. Virtual machines are dynamically allocated to any host in a cluster and can be migrated between them, according to policies defined on the cluster and settings on the virtual machines. The cluster is the highest level at which power and load-sharing policies can be defined.</p>

<p>The number of hosts and number of virtual machines that belong to a cluster are displayed in the results list under <strong>Host Count</strong> and <strong>VM Count</strong>, respectively.</p>

<p>Clusters run virtual machines or Gluster Storage Servers. These two purposes are mutually exclusive: A single cluster cannot support virtualization and storage hosts together.</p>

<p>oVirt creates a default cluster in the default data center during installation.</p>

<h3 id="optimization-settings-explained">Optimization Settings Explained</h3>

<p>Memory page sharing allows virtual machines to use up to 200% of their allocated memory by utilizing unused memory in other virtual machines. This process is based on the assumption that the virtual machines in your oVirt environment will not all be running at full capacity at the same time, allowing unused memory to be temporarily allocated to a particular virtual machine.</p>

<p>CPU Thread Handling allows hosts to run virtual machines with a total number of processor cores greater than number of cores in the host. This is useful for non-CPU-intensive workloads, where allowing a greater number of virtual machines to run can reduce hardware requirements. It also allows virtual machines to run with CPU topologies that would otherwise not be possible, specifically if the number of guest cores is between the number of host cores and number of host threads.</p>

<p>The table below describes the settings for the <strong>Optimization</strong> tab in the <strong>New Cluster</strong> and <strong>Edit Cluster</strong> windows.</p>

    <p>The exposed host threads would be treated as cores which can be utilized by virtual machines. For example, a 24-core system with 2 threads per core (48 threads total) can run virtual machines with up to 48 cores each, and the algorithms to calculate host CPU load would compare load against twice as many potential utilized cores.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Memory Balloon</b></td>
   <td>
    <p>Selecting the <b>Enable Memory Balloon Optimization</b> check box enables memory overcommitment on virtual machines running on the hosts in this cluster. When this option is set, the Memory Overcommit Manager (MoM) will start ballooning where and when possible, with a limitation of the guaranteed memory size of every virtual machine.</p>
    <p>To have a balloon running, the virtual machine needs to have a balloon device with relevant drivers. Each virtual machine includes a balloon device unless specifically removed. Each host in this cluster receives a balloon policy update when its status changes to <tt>Up</tt>. If necessary, you can manually update the balloon policy on a host without having to change the status. See <a href="Updating_the_MoM_Policy_on_Hosts_in_a_Cluster">Updating the MoM Policy on Hosts in a Cluster</a>.</p>
    <p>It is important to understand that in some scenarios ballooning may collide with KSM. In such cases MoM will try to adjust the balloon size to minimize collisions. Additionally, in some scenarios ballooning may cause sub-optimal performance for a virtual machine. Administrators are advised to use ballooning optimization with caution.</p>

<p>Scheduling policies allow you to specify the usage and distribution of virtual machines between available hosts. Define the scheduling policy to enable automatic load balancing across the hosts in a cluster. Regardless of the scheduling policy, a virtual machine will not start on a host with an overloaded CPU. By default, a host’s CPU is considered overloaded if it has a load of more than 80% for 5 minutes, but these values can be changed using scheduling policies. See the “Scheduling Policies” section for more information about scheduling policies.</p>

     <li><b>SpmVmGrace</b>: Defines the number of slots for virtual machines to be reserved on SPM hosts. The SPM host will have a lower load than other hosts, so this variable defines how many fewer virtual machines than other hosts it can run. The default value is <b>5</b>.</li>
     <li><b>CpuOverCommitDurationMinutes</b>: Sets the time (in minutes) that a host can run a CPU load outside of the defined utilization values before the scheduling policy takes action. The defined time interval protects against temporary spikes in CPU load activating scheduling policies and instigating unnecessary virtual machine migration. Maximum two characters. The default value is <b>2</b>.</li>
     <li><b>HighUtilization</b>: Expressed as a percentage. If the host runs with CPU usage at or above the high utilization value for the defined time interval, the oVirt Engine migrates virtual machines to other hosts in the cluster until the host's CPU load is below the maximum service threshold. The default value is <b>80</b>.</li>
     <li><b>LowUtilization</b>: Expressed as a percentage. If the host runs with CPU usage below the low utilization value for the defined time interval, the oVirt Engine will migrate virtual machines to other hosts in the cluster. The Manager will power down the original host machine, and restart it again when load balancing requires or there are not enough free hosts in the cluster. The default value is <b>20</b>.</li>
     <li><b>ScaleDown</b>: Reduces the impact of the <b>HA Reservation</b> weight function, by dividing a host's score by the specified amount. This is an optional property that can be added to any policy, including <b>none</b>.</li>
     <li><b>HostsInReserve</b>: Specifies a number of hosts to keep running even though there are no running virtual machines on them. This is an optional property that can be added to the <b>power_saving</b> policy.</li>
     <li><b>EnableAutomaticHostPowerManagement</b>: Enables automatic power management for all hosts in the cluster. This is an optional property that can be added to the <b>power_saving</b> policy. The default value is <b>true</b>.</li>
     <li><b>MaxFreeMemoryForOverUtilized</b>: Sets the maximum free memory required in MB for the minimum service level. If the host's memory usage runs at, or above this value, the oVirt Engine migrates virtual machines to other hosts in the cluster until the host's available memory is below the minimum service threshold. Setting both <b>MaxFreeMemoryForOverUtilized</b> and <b>MinFreeMemoryForUnderUtilized</b> to 0 MB disables memory based balancing. This is an optional property that can be added to the <b>power_saving</b> and <b>evenly_distributed</b> policies.</li>
     <li><b>MinFreeMemoryForUnderUtilized</b>: Sets the minimum free memory required in MB before the host is considered underutilized. If the host's memory usage runs below this value, the oVirt Engine migrates virtual machines to other hosts in the cluster and will automatically power down the host machine, and restart it again when load balancing requires or there are not enough free hosts in the cluster. Setting both <b>MaxFreeMemoryForOverUtilized</b> and <b>MinFreeMemoryForUnderUtilized</b> to 0MB disables memory based balancing. This is an optional property that can be added to the <b>power_saving</b> and <b>evenly_distributed</b> policies.</li>

<h3 id="updating-the-mom-policy-on-hosts-in-a-cluster">Updating the MoM Policy on Hosts in a Cluster</h3>

<p>The Memory Overcommit Manager handles memory balloon and KSM functions on a host. Changes to these functions at the cluster level are only passed to hosts the next time a host moves to a status of <strong>Up</strong> after being rebooted or in maintenance mode. However, if necessary you can apply important changes to a host immediately by synchronizing the MoM policy while the host is <strong>Up</strong>. The following procedure must be performed on each host individually.</p>

<p><strong>Synchronizing MoM Policy on a Host</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Compute</strong> → <strong>Clusters</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the cluster’s name to open the details view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Hosts</strong> tab and select the host that requires an updated MoM policy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Sync MoM Policy</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The MoM policy on the host is updated without having to move the host to maintenance mode and back <strong>Up</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-cpu-profile">Creating a CPU Profile</h3>

<p>CPU profiles define the maximum amount of processing capability a virtual machine in a cluster can access on the host on which it runs, expressed as a percent of the total processing capability available to that host. CPU profiles are created based on CPU profiles defined under data centers, and are not automatically applied to all virtual machines in a cluster; they must be manually assigned to individual virtual machines for the profile to take effect.</p>

<p>This procedure assumes you have already defined one or more CPU quality of service entries under the data center to which the cluster belongs.</p>

<p><strong>Creating a CPU Profile</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Compute</strong> → <strong>Clusters</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the cluster’s name to open the details view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p>If the CPU profile was assigned to any virtual machines, those virtual machines are automatically assigned the <code>default</code> CPU profile.</p>

<h3 id="importing-an-existing-gluster-storage-cluster">Importing an Existing Gluster Storage Cluster</h3>

<p>You can import a Gluster Storage cluster and all hosts belonging to the cluster into oVirt Engine.</p>

<p>When you provide details such as the IP address or host name and password of any host in the cluster, the <code>gluster peer status</code> command is executed on that host through SSH, then displays a list of hosts that are a part of the cluster. You must manually verify the fingerprint of each host and provide passwords for them. You will not be able to import the cluster if one of the hosts in the cluster is down or unreachable. As the newly imported hosts do not have VDSM installed, the bootstrap script installs all the necessary VDSM packages on the hosts after they have been imported, and reboots them.</p>

<p><strong>Importing an Existing Gluster Storage Cluster to oVirt Engine</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Compute</strong> → <strong>Clusters</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>New</strong>.</p>

  <li>
    <p>In the <strong>Hostname</strong> field, enter the hostname or IP address of any server in the cluster.</p>

    <p>The host <strong>SSH Fingerprint</strong> displays to ensure you are connecting with the correct host. If a host is unreachable or if there is a network error, an error <strong>Error in fetching fingerprint</strong> displays in the <strong>Fingerprint</strong> field.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter the <strong>Root Password</strong> for the server, and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>Add Hosts</strong> window opens, and a list of hosts that are a part of the cluster displays.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For each host, enter the <strong>Name</strong> and the <strong>Root Password</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you wish to use the same password for all hosts, select the <strong>Use a Common Password</strong> check box to enter the password in the provided text field.</p>

    <p>Click <strong>Apply</strong> to set the entered password all hosts.</p>

    <p>Make sure the fingerprints are valid and submit your changes by clicking <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The bootstrap script installs all the necessary VDSM packages on the hosts after they have been imported, and reboots them. You have now successfully imported an existing Gluster Storage cluster into oVirt Engine.</p>

<h3 id="explanation-of-settings-in-the-add-hosts-window">Explanation of Settings in the Add Hosts Window</h3>

<p>The <strong>Add Hosts</strong> window allows you to specify the details of the hosts imported as part of a Gluster-enabled cluster.
