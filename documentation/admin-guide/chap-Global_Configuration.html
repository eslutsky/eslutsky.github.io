<h1 id="chapter-1-global-configuration">Chapter 1: Global Configuration</h1>

<p>Accessed by clicking <strong>Administration</strong> → <strong>Configure</strong>, the <strong>Configure</strong> window allows you to configure a number of global resources for your oVirt environment, such as users, roles, system permissions, scheduling policies, instance types, and MAC address pools. This window allows you to customize the way in which users interact with resources in the environment, and provides a central location for configuring options that can be applied to multiple clusters.</p>

<h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>

<p>Roles are predefined sets of privileges that can be configured from oVirt Engine. Roles provide access and management permissions to different levels of resources in the data center, and to specific physical and virtual resources.</p>

<p>With multilevel administration, any permissions which apply to a container object also apply to all individual objects within that container. For example, when a host administrator role is assigned to a user on a specific host, the user gains permissions to perform any of the available host operations, but only on the assigned host. However, if the host administrator role is assigned to a user on a data center, the user gains permissions to perform host operations on all hosts within the cluster of the data center.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-new-role">Creating a New Role</h3>

<p>If the role you require is not on oVirt's default list of roles, you can create a new role and customize it to suit your purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Creating a New Role</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Administration</strong> → <strong>Configure</strong> to open the <strong>Configure</strong> window. The <strong>Roles</strong> tab is selected by default, showing a list of default User and Administrator roles, and any custom roles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>New</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter the <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Description</strong> of the new role.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select either <strong>Admin</strong> or <strong>User</strong> as the <strong>Account Type</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <strong>Expand All</strong> or <strong>Collapse All</strong> buttons to view more or fewer of the permissions for the listed objects in the <strong>Check Boxes to Allow Action</strong> list. You can also expand or collapse the options for each object.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For each of the objects, select or clear the actions you wish to permit or deny for the role you are setting up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong> to apply the changes you have made. The new role displays on the list of roles.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="editing-or-copying-a-role">Editing or Copying a Role</h3>

<p>You can change the settings for roles you have created, but you cannot change default roles. To change default roles, clone and modify them to suit your requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Editing or Copying a Role</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Administration</strong> → <strong>Configure</strong> to open the <strong>Configure</strong> window. The window shows a list of default User and Administrator roles, and any custom roles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the role you wish to change. Click <strong>Edit</strong> to open the <strong>Edit Role</strong> window, or click <strong>Copy</strong> to open the <strong>Copy Role</strong> window.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong> to apply the changes you have made.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="user-role-and-authorization-examples">User Role and Authorization Examples</h3>

<p>The following examples illustrate how to apply authorization controls for various scenarios, using the different features of the authorization system described in this chapter.</p>

<p><strong>Cluster Permissions</strong></p>

<p>Sarah is the system administrator for the accounts department of a company. All the virtual resources for her department are organized under an oVirt <strong>cluster</strong> called <code>Accounts</code>. She is assigned the <strong>ClusterAdmin</strong> role on the accounts cluster. This enables her to manage all virtual machines in the cluster, since the virtual machines are child objects of the cluster. Managing the virtual machines includes editing, adding, or removing virtual resources such as disks, and taking snapshots. It does not allow her to manage any resources outside this cluster. Because <strong>ClusterAdmin</strong> is an administrator role, it allows her to use the Administration Portal to manage these resources, but does not give her any access via the VM Portal.</p>

<p><strong>VM PowerUser Permissions</strong></p>

<p>John is a software developer in the accounts department. He uses virtual machines to build and test his software. Sarah has created a virtual desktop called <code>johndesktop</code> for him. John is assigned the <strong>UserVmManager</strong> role on the <code>johndesktop</code> virtual machine. This allows him to access this single virtual machine using the VM Portal. Because he has <strong>UserVmManager</strong> permissions, he can modify the virtual machine and add resources to it, such as new virtual disks. Because <strong>UserVmManager</strong> is a user role, it does not allow him to use the Administration Portal.</p>

<p><strong>Data Center Power User Role Permissions</strong></p>

<p>Penelope is an office manager. In addition to her own responsibilities, she occasionally helps the HR manager with recruitment tasks, such as scheduling interviews and following up on reference checks. As per corporate policy, Penelope needs to use a particular application for recruitment tasks.</p>

<p>While Penelope has her own machine for office management tasks, she wants to create a separate virtual machine to run the recruitment application. She is assigned <strong>PowerUserRole</strong> permissions for the data center in which her new virtual machine will reside. This is because to create a new virtual machine, she needs to make changes to several components within the data center, including creating the virtual disk in the storage domain.</p>

<p>Note that this is not the same as assigning <strong>DataCenterAdmin</strong> privileges to Penelope. As a PowerUser for a data center, Penelope can log in to the VM Portal and perform virtual machine-specific actions on virtual machines within the data center. She cannot perform data center-level operations such as attaching hosts or storage to a data center.</p>

<p><strong>Network Administrator Permissions</strong></p>

<p>Chris works as the network administrator in the IT department. Her day-to-day responsibilities include creating, manipulating, and removing networks in the department’s oVirt environment. For her role, she requires administrative privileges on the resources and on the networks of each resource. For example, if Chris has <strong>NetworkAdmin</strong> privileges on the IT department’s data center, she can add and remove networks in the data center, and attach and detach networks for all virtual machines belonging to the data center.</p>

<p><strong>Custom Role Permissions</strong></p>

<p>Rachel works in the IT department, and is responsible for managing user accounts in oVirt. She needs permission to add user accounts and assign them the appropriate roles and permissions. She does not use any virtual machines herself, and should not have access to administration of hosts, virtual machines, clusters or data centers. There is no built-in role which provides her with this specific set of permissions. A custom role must be created to define the set of permissions appropriate to Rachel's position.</p>

<p><strong>UserManager Custom Role</strong></p>

<p><img alt="" width="650" height="500" src="/images/admin-guide/6568.png?1560777613" /></p>

<p>The <strong>UserManager</strong> custom role shown above allows manipulation of users, permissions and roles. These actions are organized under <code>System</code> - the top level object of the hierarchy shown in <a href="rhev-object-hierarchy">rhev-object-hierarchy</a>. This means they apply to all other objects in the system. The role is set to have an <strong>Account Type</strong> of <strong>Admin</strong>. This means that when she is assigned this role, Rachel can only use the Administration Portal, not the VM Portal.</p>

<h2 id="system-permissions">System Permissions</h2>

<p>Permissions enable users to perform actions on objects, where objects are either individual objects or container objects.</p>

<p><strong>Permissions &amp; Roles</strong></p>

<p><img alt="" width="444" height="240" src="/images/admin-guide/496.png?1560777613" /></p>

<p>Any permissions that apply to a container object also apply to all members of that container. The following diagram depicts the hierarchy of objects in the system.</p>

<p><strong>oVirt Object Hierarchy</strong></p>

<p><img alt="" width="444" height="352" src="/images/admin-guide/492.png?1560777613" /></p>

<h3 id="user-properties">User Properties</h3>

<p>Roles and permissions are the properties of the user. Roles are predefined sets of privileges that permit access to different levels of physical and virtual resources. Multilevel administration provides a finely grained hierarchy of permissions. For example, a data center administrator has permissions to manage all objects in the data center, while a host administrator has system administrator permissions to a single physical host. A user can have permissions to use a single virtual machine but not make any changes to the virtual machine configurations, while another user can be assigned system permissions to a virtual machine.</p>

<h3 id="user-and-administrator-roles">User and Administrator Roles</h3>

<p>oVirt provides a range of pre-configured roles, from an administrator with system-wide permissions to an end user with access to a single virtual machine. While you cannot change or remove the default roles, you can clone and customize them, or create new roles according to your requirements. There are two types of roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Administrator Role: Allows access to the <strong>Administration Portal</strong> for managing physical and virtual resources. An administrator role confers permissions for actions to be performed in the VM Portal; however, it has no bearing on what a user can see in the VM Portal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>User Role: Allows access to the <strong>VM Portal</strong> for managing and accessing virtual machines and templates. A user role determines what a user can see in the VM Portal. Permissions granted to a user with an administrator role are reflected in the actions available to that user in the VM Portal.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="user-roles-explained">User Roles Explained</h3>

    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="managing-system-permissions-for-a-data-center">Managing System Permissions for a Data Center</h3>

<p>As the <strong>SuperUser</strong>, the system administrator manages all aspects of the Administration Portal. More specific administrative roles can be assigned to other users. These restricted administrator roles are useful for granting a user administrative privileges that limit them to a specific resource. For example, a <strong>DataCenterAdmin</strong> role has administrator privileges only for the assigned data center with the exception of the storage for that data center, and a <strong>ClusterAdmin</strong> has administrator privileges only for the assigned cluster.</p>

<p>A data center administrator is a system administration role for a specific data center only. This is useful in virtualization environments with multiple data centers where each data center requires an administrator. The <strong>DataCenterAdmin</strong> role is a hierarchical model; a user assigned the data center administrator role for a data center can manage all objects in the data center with the exception of storage for that data center. Use the <strong>Configure</strong> button in the header bar to assign a data center administrator for all data centers in the environment.</p>

<p>The data center administrator role permits the following actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Create and remove clusters associated with the data center.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add and remove hosts, virtual machines, and pools associated with the data center.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Edit user permissions for virtual machines associated with the data center.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can only assign roles and permissions to existing users.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can change the system administrator of a data center by removing the existing system administrator and adding the new system administrator.</p>

<p>As the <strong>SuperUser</strong>, the system administrator manages all aspects of the Administration Portal. More specific administrative roles can be assigned to other users. These restricted administrator roles are useful for granting a user administrative privileges that limit them to a specific resource. For example, a <strong>DataCenterAdmin</strong> role has administrator privileges only for the assigned data center with the exception of the storage for that data center, and a <strong>ClusterAdmin</strong> has administrator privileges only for the assigned cluster.</p>

<p>A cluster administrator is a system administration role for a specific cluster only. This is useful in data centers with multiple clusters, where each cluster requires a system administrator. The <strong>ClusterAdmin</strong> role is a hierarchical model: a user assigned the cluster administrator role for a cluster can manage all objects in the cluster. Use the <strong>Configure</strong> button in the header bar to assign a cluster administrator for all clusters in the environment.</p>

<p>The cluster administrator role permits the following actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Create and remove associated clusters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add and remove hosts, virtual machines, and pools associated with the cluster.</p>

<h2 id="scheduling-policies">Scheduling Policies</h2>

<p>A scheduling policy is a set of rules that defines the logic by which virtual machines are distributed amongst hosts in the cluster that scheduling policy is applied to. Scheduling policies determine this logic via a combination of filters, weightings, and a load balancing policy. The filter modules apply hard enforcement and filter out hosts that do not meet the conditions specified by that filter. The weights modules apply soft enforcement, and are used to control the relative priority of factors considered when determining the hosts in a cluster on which a virtual machine can run.</p>

<p>The oVirt Engine provides five default scheduling policies: <strong>Evenly_Distributed</strong>, <strong>Cluster_Maintenance</strong>, <strong>None</strong>, <strong>Power_Saving</strong>, and <strong>VM_Evenly_Distributed</strong>. You can also define new scheduling policies that provide fine-grained control over the distribution of virtual machines. Regardless of the scheduling policy, a virtual machine will not start on a host with an overloaded CPU. By default, a host’s CPU is considered overloaded if it has a load of more than 80% for 5 minutes, but these values can be changed using scheduling policies. See the “Scheduling Policy Settings Explained” section for more information about the properties of each scheduling policy.</p>

<p><strong>Evenly Distributed Scheduling Policy</strong></p>

<p><img alt="Evenly Distributed Scheduling Policy" width="1520" height="574" src="/images/admin-guide/EvenlyDistributed.png?1560777613" /></p>

<p>The <strong>Evenly_Distributed</strong> scheduling policy distributes the memory and CPU processing load evenly across all hosts in the cluster. Additional virtual machines attached to a host will not start if that host has reached the defined <strong>CpuOverCommitDurationMinutes</strong>, <strong>HighUtilization</strong>, or <strong>MaxFreeMemoryForOverUtilized</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>VM_Evenly_Distributed</strong> scheduling policy virtual machines evenly between hosts based on a count of the virtual machines. The cluster is considered unbalanced if any host is running more virtual machines than the <strong>HighVmCount</strong> and there is at least one host with a virtual machine count that falls outside of the <strong>MigrationThreshold</strong>.</p>

<p><img alt="Power Saving Scheduling Policy" width="1520" height="573" src="/images/admin-guide/PowerSaving.png?1560777613" /></p>

<p>The <strong>Power_Saving</strong> scheduling policy distributes the memory and CPU processing load across a subset of available hosts to reduce power consumption on underutilized hosts. Hosts with a CPU load below the low utilization value for longer than the defined time interval will migrate all virtual machines to other hosts so that it can be powered down. Additional virtual machines attached to a host will not start if that host has reached the defined high utilization value.</p>

<p>Set the <strong>None</strong> policy to have no load or power sharing between hosts for running virtual machines. This is the default mode. When a virtual machine is started, the memory and CPU processing load is spread evenly across all hosts in the cluster. Additional virtual machines attached to a host will not start if that host has reached the defined <strong>CpuOverCommitDurationMinutes</strong>, <strong>HighUtilization</strong>, or <strong>MaxFreeMemoryForOverUtilized</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Cluster_Maintenance</strong> scheduling policy limits activity in a cluster during maintenance tasks. When the <strong>Cluster_Maintenance</strong> policy is set, no new virtual machines may be started, except highly available virtual machines. If host failure occurs, highly available virtual machines will restart properly and any virtual machine can migrate.</p>

<p>The instance type is removed from the <strong>Instance Types</strong> list and can no longer be used when creating a new virtual machine. Any virtual machines that were attached to the removed instance type will now be attached to <strong>Custom</strong> (no instance type).</p>

<h2 id="mac-address-pools">MAC Address Pools</h2>

<p>MAC address pools define the range(s) of MAC addresses allocated for each cluster. A MAC address pool is specified for each cluster. By using MAC address pools, oVirt can automatically generate and assign MAC addresses to new virtual network devices, which helps to prevent MAC address duplication. MAC address pools are more memory efficient when all MAC addresses related to a cluster are within the range for the assigned MAC address pool.</p>

<p>The same MAC address pool can be shared by multiple clusters, but each cluster has a single MAC address pool assigned. A default MAC address pool is created by oVirt and is used if another MAC address pool is not assigned. For more information about assigning MAC address pools to clusters see “Creating a New Cluster” section in Chapter 5.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If more than one oVirt cluster shares a network, do not rely solely on the default MAC address pool because the virtual machines of each cluster will try to use the same range of MAC addresses, leading to conflicts. To avoid MAC address conflicts, check the MAC address pool ranges to ensure that each cluster is assigned a unique MAC address range.</p>

<p>The MAC address pool assigns the next available MAC address following the last address that was returned to the pool. If there are no further addresses left in the range, the search starts again from the beginning of the range. If there are multiple MAC address ranges with available MAC addresses defined in a single MAC address pool, the ranges take turns in serving incoming requests in the same way available MAC addresses are selected.</p>

<h3 id="creating-mac-address-pools">Creating MAC Address Pools</h3>

<p>You can create new MAC address pools.</p>

<p><strong>Creating a MAC Address Pool</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Administration</strong> → <strong>Configure</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>MAC Address Pools</strong> tab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Add</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter the <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Description</strong> of the new MAC address pool.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the <strong>Allow Duplicates</strong> check box to allow a MAC address to be used multiple times in a pool. The MAC address pool will not automatically use a duplicate MAC address, but enabling the duplicates option means a user can manually use a duplicate MAC address.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If one MAC address pool has duplicates disabled, and another has duplicates enabled, each MAC address can be used once in the pool with duplicates disabled but can be used multiple times in the pool with duplicates enabled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter the required <strong>MAC Address Ranges</strong>. To enter multiple ranges click the plus button next to the <strong>From</strong> and <strong>To</strong> fields.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="editing-mac-address-pools">Editing MAC Address Pools</h3>

<p>You can edit MAC address pools to change the details, including the range of MAC addresses available in the pool and whether duplicates are allowed.</p>

<p><strong>Editing MAC Address Pool Properties</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Administration</strong> → <strong>Configure</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>MAC Address Pools</strong> tab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the MAC address pool to be edited.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Edit</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Change the <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>Description</strong>, <strong>Allow Duplicates</strong>, and <strong>MAC Address Ranges</strong> fields as required.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> When a MAC address range is updated, the MAC addresses of existing NICs are not reassigned. MAC addresses that were already assigned, but are outside of the new MAC address range, are added as user-specified MAC addresses and are still tracked by that MAC address pool.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="editing-mac-address-pool-permissions">Editing MAC Address Pool Permissions</h3>

<p>After a MAC address pool has been created, you can edit its user permissions. The user permissions control which data centers can use the MAC address pool. See the "<a href="sect-Roles">Roles</a>" section for more information on adding new user permissions.</p>

<p><strong>Editing MAC Address Pool Permissions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Administration</strong> → <strong>Configure</strong>.</p>
